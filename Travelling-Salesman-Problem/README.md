# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## Description
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: 
"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" 

Although the salesmen problem was probably never important for salesmen it is very important within **vehicle routing** and **job sequencing**, among other industrial applications.   

## Key Take-Away
The key idea is that, even if the number of constraints to completely specify a correct model is large, it may be possible to include a very small fraction of the for instance required constraints and yet solve the problem to optimality. 
To do this effectively, one must have a deep understanding of the problem and good practical modeling skills (and of course, a good modeling language and library, such as Python and Google OR-Tools).
